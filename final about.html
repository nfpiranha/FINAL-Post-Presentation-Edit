	<p>The site is meant to be historically focused and dedicated to keeping art accessible to all. While anyone can go online and view paintings, understanding the context behind them can transform the work entirely and inspire in unexpected ways. It adds a magical and unpredicatable dimension to already provoking work, and it's often left exclusive to in-person viewings. This site's goal is to bridge the gap between context and the art itself. There will hopefully be more images as the site progresses.
